* 5 points - Uses data from at least two different sources: local file, internet, web service, relational database, AWS S3, etc; and formats: CSV, JSON, database, XML, Excel, etc
* 5 points - Data from multiple sources has to be joined together at least twice
* 5 points - Data is aggregated or pivoted at least twice during the program
* 5 points - Some kind of field-level transformation is performed at least 5 times
* 5 points - The program creates 3 or more data visualizations 
* 5 points - The program serves a theoretical purpose described in documentation, that could potentially do something in healthcare or another industry of interest

**Modularity / Style**
* 15 points - The code is broken up into various functions or classes to make testing and reuse easier

**Documentation and Professionalism**
* 15 points - All functions are documented and notebook cells include annotations and explanations.


**(-2) Variable names like `df1`, `m`, `df`, and `df2` are unacceptable.  Your variable names have to explain what the content is or what the user/developer can do with it.**

**(-1) You wrote some code that says _df_12.plot(...) but _df_12 isn't defined anywhere.  This is very confusing, especially with no comments to help.**

**(-1) You're missing a lot of commentary that would have been helpful. Why are doing the things we're doing?**

**(-5) You didn't do any merging of data**

**(-5) You didn't do any pivot tables or aggregation of data**

**(-3) I didn't see any significant field-level transformations in your code, but gave you credit for renaming some columns.**
